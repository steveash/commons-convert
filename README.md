# commons-convert
This is a fork/mirror of [Apache Commons Convert](https://commons.apache.org/sandbox/commons-convert/index.html)

No code has been changed outside of the POM in order to get this released on maven central under my groupid. If the
Apache guys ever release theirs them obviously switch to that.

If you want to use my mirror that I've released as a 0.90.0 version then use the maven coordinates:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.steveash.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-convert</artifactId>
  <version>0.90.0</version>
</dependency>
```
